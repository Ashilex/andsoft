Elon Musk is making me look stupid.

He’s making me look stupid because, since he acquired Twitter last year for a fee in the region of $44bn, I’ve consistently expected him to start behaving rationally. As everyone has predicted the death of the bird-based social network, I’ve kept saying: relax. Things will end up back where they started. Musk will focus on SpaceX and Tesla, and we’ll return to the mid-value Twitter of the 2010s.

And, to some extent, I think that’s where we are. Twitter right now is much less functionally different, compared to a year ago, than people would have you think. There have undoubtedly been changes to the way the timeline is constructed — a greater emphasis, for example, on tweets by accounts that you’re not following — but that’s no bad thing. It’s a pretty similar algorithmic tweak to the one that Instagram has made, or the one that TikTok is built on. This new Twitter is less focused on closed circles, more focused on discoverability. I struggle to find a particularly strong critique of this development.
More transformative has been the total destruction of Twitter’s revenue stream. Again, I still think this was not necessarily a thoughtless action: most digital media services would rather run on a subscription-based revenue system than an advertising one. The problem has been that the subscription offering — Twitter Blue — isn’t very good, and has done a lot of damage to the core brand’s reputation. Not least, it has totally destabilised the platform’s curated sense of “trust”, an asset that Musk thinks is low value but his advertisers think is high value. And therefore Twitter has tanked with its biggest revenue stream, advertising.
